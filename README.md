## Overview
ImageProcessorApp is a Python application designed for basic image processing. It provides a user interface to load and process images using various techniques, including grayscale conversion, adaptive thresholding, contour detection, and visualization of image transformations.

## Features
- Load images from the filesystem.
- Convert images to grayscale for simpler analysis.
- Apply adaptive thresholding for localized image segmentation.
- Detect and filter contours based on area.
- Visualize original, grayscale, binary, and contoured images.

## Dependencies
- tkinter: For the graphical user interface.
- PIL (Python Imaging Library): To handle image operations.
- OpenCV (cv2): For advanced image processing functionalities.
- NumPy: For numerical operations on images.
- Matplotlib: For plotting and visualizing images and transformations.


## Usage
Run the script in a Python environment. The GUI will allow you to load an image and automatically process and display it in various formats.
